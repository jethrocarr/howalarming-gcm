# HowAlarming GCM Server

This small Java application provides a bridge between
[HowAlarming](https://github.com/jethrocarr/howalarming) and Google Compute
Messaging (GCM) used by the companion Android and iOS apps.

Unlike the lightweight `alert_gcm.py`, this service offers bi-directional
communication between applications which enables in-app actions to be relayed
through to the alarm system.

Based heavily on the FriendlyPing example application published by Google.


# Application Registration

Application registration is automatic - when the phone apps are launched they
send a registration message to the server and are added to the list of known
devices to send push messages to.

TODO: We need to set this up to save state, currently it only remains in the
server for the duration of it's run time.


# Requirements

This application should build and execute with Java 7 or Java 8.


# Build & Execution

You can build the application as a standalone JAR file using `gradle` by
running:

    gradle fatJar

This creates a standalone JAR file in `./build/libs/HowAlarmingServer-all-VERSON.jar`
which includes all the dependencies and is ready-to-run as a foreground server
with:

    export GCM_SERVER_ID=123
    export GCM_API_KEY=abc
    java -jar ./build/libs/HowAlarmingServer-all-VERSON.jar

All configuration is specified via environmentals, as per the above example.
